# Introduction to TypeScript

TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, making your code more robust and maintainable.

## Key Benefits

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time
- **Better IDE Support**: Enhanced autocomplete and refactoring
- **Improved Documentation**: Types serve as inline documentation

## Basic Types

```typescript
let name: string = "John";
let age: number = 30;
let isActive: boolean = true;
```

## Interfaces

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}
```

Give TypeScript a try in your next project!
