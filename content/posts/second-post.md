# Getting Started with React

React has revolutionized the way we build user interfaces. In this post, we'll explore the fundamental concepts.

## Core Concepts

### Components

Components are the building blocks of React applications. They can be functional or class-based.

```javascript
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

### Props

Props allow you to pass data from parent to child components.

### State

State allows components to create and manage their own data.

## Conclusion

React makes building interactive UIs straightforward and enjoyable!
